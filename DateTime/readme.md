In Python, date and time are not a data type of their own, but a module named datetime can be imported to work with the date as well as time. Python Datetime module comes built into Python, so there is no need to install it externally. 

Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually manipulating objects and not string or timestamps.
