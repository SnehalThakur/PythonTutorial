**Abstraction**

Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. An abstraction is used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity. It also enhances the application efficiency.
