**Functions**

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation/operation and produce output. 

The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

We can create our own functions. These functions are known as **User Defines Functions**.
